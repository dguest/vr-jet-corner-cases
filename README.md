ATLAS Jet Radii Issues
======================

We do weird things with jet association in ATLAS.

If you want to get a plot of all the radii we use for different
things, run `./plot_them.py`. This will make `genfigs` with some
figures.

If you want a whole presentation about it, go to `talk` and run
`make`.
